# Overview
Elyx is a next-generation health platform designed to maximize the number of healthy years in a member’s life. Unlike traditional healthcare systems that focus on treating illness, Elyx emphasizes prevention, optimization, and personalization. The web application acts as the central hub where members, doctors, and specialists collaborate seamlessly with AI to manage health journeys.

# Core Features

1. Personalized Health Journey Dashboard

Each member has a unique, evolving health journey that combines medical history, lifestyle goals, wearable data, and interventions.

The dashboard provides a real-time view of current progress, active plans, and outcomes.

2. Decision Tracking & Transparency

Every medical or lifestyle recommendation (exercise, nutrition, therapy, or medication) includes a clear explanation of why it was chosen.

Users can trace decisions back to conversations, diagnostics, or physician reviews for full accountability.

3. AI-Powered Insights

AI synthesizes data from wearables (Garmin, Oura, Whoop), lab tests, and health apps to detect patterns and suggest optimizations.

Personalized recommendations evolve dynamically as new data is collected.

4. Communication Hub

WhatsApp-style messaging between members and the Elyx team (concierge, doctors, nutritionists, physiotherapists).

Handles routine check-ins, intervention updates, diagnostic results, and personalized follow-ups.

Members can initiate up to 5 queries per week (reflecting natural curiosity and research).

5. Journey Visualization

Interactive timeline of the member’s journey: onboarding, diagnostic tests, interventions, therapy sessions, and results.

Allows members and providers to see not only what is happening but also why it happened.

6. Progress Monitoring & Reports

Monthly executive summaries with actionable insights and quarterly deep-dive reports.

Tracks key metrics: blood markers, cognitive scores, VO₂max, biological age, stress resilience, sleep quality.

AI-driven progress visualization (graphs, milestones, before/after states).

7. Team & Resource Coordination
